# Overview

This is a simple chatroom I made using Python, HTML, and Javascript to get a basic grasp of networking. I developed the server using python and the client using HTML and Javascript. In order to start the program simply run the app.py file from an IDE or run python app.py in your terminal. The terminal should then display a local address (e.g. 127.0.0.1:5000) and another address using your ip address that can be accessed from any device on your local network through any internet browser.

# Network Communication

This program utilizes a client/server system using TCP on port 5000. The messages sent are formatted as plain text.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
In developing this software I used VSCode as an IDE and a browser to test everything. The languages I used include Python, HTML, and Javascript. I also used the flask, flask_socketio, and the Socket.IO client libraries.

# Useful Websites

* [SocketIO documentation](https://socket.io/docs/v4/)
* [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/)

# Future Work

* Enhance the UI
* Display the relevant username next to each message
* Make it accessible beyond local networks
